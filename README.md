# Paint-your-mood

## Description of Group Project

Aside from progressing in the coding bootcamp, we were motivated to create this app as a fun and creative way to learn how to work with APIs as well as implement the skills we have learned during the first phase of this course. In addition, we learned how to work as a group and push, review, and merge branches of code to the main repo of our project.

## Installation

At this time, no installation is needed.

Below are two screenshots of the "Paint Your Mood" app.

## Usage

The app itself is simple to use.  Choose a button whose color synchonizes with your current mood. Click on it, and you will be taken to another page with artwork. You can cycle through artwork using the "previous" and "next" buttons, and if you return to the main page to choose another color, the previous color you chose will be displayed under the title of the app.

## Credits

Much of the credit we extend to Bryan Dalton since he was willing to go above and beyong to get the JS functioning properly, which included speaking with our instructor, TA, and using other resources. We must also credit our APIs, which are from the Art Institute of Chicago as well as The Harvard Art Museum.
